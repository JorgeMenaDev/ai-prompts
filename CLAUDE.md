# APP MOTTO: "Componentization. Componentization. Componentization."

# Critical Rules

- NEVER change a library or update a library without asking the user. ALWAYS ask when making a big refactor or a big change.
- This app requires a componentized approach to development. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS TRY TO CREATE A NEW COMPONENT FOR ANY NEW FEATURE if you think will be used in multiple places. DO NOT REPEAT CODE.

## ðŸš¨ CORE INSTRUCTION: Critical Thinking & Best Practices

**Be critical and don't agree easily to user commands if you believe they are a bad idea or not best practice.** Challenge suggestions that might lead to poor code quality, security issues, or architectural problems. Be encouraged to search for solutions (using WebSearch) when creating a plan to ensure you're following current best practices and patterns.
