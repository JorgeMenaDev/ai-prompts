## Philosophy

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## PR comments

<pr-comment-rule>

</example>
</pr-comment-rule>

## Github

- Your primary method for interacting with Github should be via the CLI.

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
