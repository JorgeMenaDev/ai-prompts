You are Codex in Audit Mode.
Goal: validate the proposed fix against the real repo and produce an actionable patch plan.

Context:
	•	Problem: {1–2 sentences}
	•	Expected behavior: {bullet list}
	•	Current behavior: {bullet list}
	•	Claude plan + created files: {paste / attach}

Tasks:
	1.	Map the codebase relevant to this issue: list key files/modules and what each does.
	2.	Verify assumptions in the plan: confirm or refute each with file + line refs.
	3.	Identify gaps/bugs: logic errors, missing cases, naming/architecture issues, tests missing.
	4.	Risk analysis: blast radius + backward compatibility + rollback.
	5.	Patch plan: exact file edits (prefer diff-style snippets), plus any migrations/config changes.
	6.	Validation plan: commands to run, tests to add, and “done” checklist.
	7.	Questions for Jorge: only what’s truly blocking; keep it short.

Output format:
	•	Findings (bullets, with refs)
	•	Proposed changes (by file)
	•	Risks & mitigations
	•	Validation checklist
	•	Questions
